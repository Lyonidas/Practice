#1. Define a class called apple and give it four instance variables that define attributes of a apple.

class Apple:
    def __init__(self, color, weight, stem_length, circumference):
        self.color = color
        self.weight = weight
        self.shape = stem_length
        self.circumference = circumference
        print("Created!")

#2. Create a circle class with a method calles area that calculates and returns its area.

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
        print("Created!")

    def area(self):
        return self.radius ** 2 * math.pi

circle = Circle(4)
print(circle.area())
